What Time Is It?

Have you ever been sitting wondering what time it is in another timezone?

I have. And in particular three timezones I have to deal with come up all the time, and so I made this little single page app to quickly check the time.

Theres no configuration, no options, nothing complicated. Just load the page and boom. You're there.

+ No dependencies
+ Pure ES2015 JavaScript (modern Chrome supports this out the box)
